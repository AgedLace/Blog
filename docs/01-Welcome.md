## Jesus Said, "See to it that no One Deceives You." - Matthew 24:4

> [!note] **Matthew 24:24**
> 
> 24 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders that would deceive even the elect, if that were possible.

The sole purpose for this website is to study God's Word so that I will not be deceived by anyone in these last days. It is my prayer that God might use these studies to help other believers from being deceived as well.
